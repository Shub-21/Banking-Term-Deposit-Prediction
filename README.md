# Banking-Term-Deposit-Prediction

To increase the revenue for any bank the fundamental task is for the customers to deposit more and for longer period of time. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, a term deposit client is more likely to make more purchases such as funds or insurance to further increase the bank's revenues. Here we try to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the analysis of the marketing campaigns the bank performed.
